My name is Alléxia Alcantara from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer 2018. My dream is to be able to contribute and increase my skills with open source projects, get more knowledge and techniques as a developer.

In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books, (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and podcast (:headphones:) and eventually I like to enjoy life with friends with a beer (🍺).
